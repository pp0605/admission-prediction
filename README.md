# Graduate Admission Prediction using ML

In this project, we will be using the admission _ predict dataset in csv format to predict the chances of students getting admission by a university based on several academic performance measurement. To yield the most accurate result, we will be going through several steps such as data preprocessing, t-test, cross validation, model selection, etc. to train a machine learning model, make prediction and measure its performance. Machine learning models such as Multiple Linear Regressor, Random Forest Regressor,Multiple Linear Regressor with Principal Component Analysis and Random Forest Regressor with Principal Component Analysis with minimum MSE and RMSE and maximum R-Square score are created to predict the chance of admit

The dataset contains several parameters: 
1. GRE Scores (out of 340) 
2. TOEFL Scores (out of 120) 
3. University Rating (out of 5) 
4. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5) 
5. Undergraduate GPA (out of 10) 
6. Research Experience (either 0 or 1) 
7. Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1). 
The last column is the response variable, which is a continuous value between 0 and 1, indicating the chances of getting admission.
